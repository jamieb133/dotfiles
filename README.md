### Notes to self

Run the bootstrap script which will automatically install homebrew and the required packages before cloning this repo and running the install script.
Downloads the Brewfile including necessary dependencies e.g. git which it needs to continue the install. Any new required packages should be added to this file.
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamieb133/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/bootstrap.sh)"
```

Installing xcode via mas seems to take FOREVER so just install this manually if needed.
